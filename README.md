# My Journey of Learning C Language ðŸš€

Welcome to my repository where I document my learning journey as I dive into the fundamentals and advanced concepts of the C programming language. This repository will be continuously updated with notes, exercises, projects, and reflections on my progress. Follow along as I grow and master C! ðŸ˜Š

## Why I'm Learning C

C is one of the most foundational and widely-used programming languages. It provides me with a deep understanding of how programming languages work at the low level, enhances my problem-solving skills, and opens the door to learning other languages like C++, Rust, and systems programming in general.

## Journey Milestones ðŸ“…

### Phase 1: Getting Started
- **Introduction to C**
  - Setting up the development environment
  - Understanding the structure of a C program
  - Writing my first "Hello, World!" program

- **Basic Syntax and Concepts**
  - Data types and variables
  - Input/output operations
  - Control flow (if-else, switch)

### Phase 2: Deep Dive into Core Concepts
- **Functions and Recursion**
  - Function declarations, definitions, and scope
  - Writing recursive functions
- **Pointers and Memory Management**
  - Understanding pointers, memory addresses, and pointer arithmetic
  - Dynamic memory allocation with `malloc` and `free`

### Phase 3: Working on Projects and Challenges
- **Building Small Projects**
  - A basic calculator
  - A number guessing game
  - Simple file-handling project
- **Solving Algorithmic Problems**
  - Arrays, sorting algorithms, and searching techniques

### Phase 4: Advanced Topics and Further Learning
- **Structs and Unions**
  - Using `struct` to create complex data types
  - Exploring unions in C
- **File I/O and Command Line Arguments**
  - Reading from and writing to files
  - Parsing command line arguments in C programs

## What You'll Find in This Repository ðŸ“‚

1. **Notes**: Markdown files summarizing each topic.
2. **Code**: A collection of programs and exercises organized by topics.
3. **Projects**: Real-world mini-projects to put theory into practice.
4. **Reflections**: Personal thoughts and insights on the learning process, challenges faced, and goals achieved.
